#Atom Heart Microengine v0.3a

Small data-oriented 2D game engine written in C++ and SFML.

Not ready for any kind of use yet. I'm changing design and architecture on a daily basis.

##Architecture

Data-oriented design for fast, multithreaded game execution. Based on Entity-Component system, with a central modular systems manager.

##TODO

Well, mostly everything. Have to write the base systems and components.
